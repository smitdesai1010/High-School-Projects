**Please use a Turbo C++ compiler for this applications.

**Matrix-Inverse Calculator**: To quickly check and find the solutions of problems regarding complex matrix calculations, I developed                                    Matrix-Inverse Calculator which can be used to find the inverse of any 2-D and 3-D matrix instantly. 

**Rock Paper Scissor**: Developed a simple Rock-Paper-Scissor game during a free class with an interactive UI in CLI. It uses some basic                           tricks (clearscreen command and loops) to mimic a behaviour which reflects that the bot is randomly choosing a                             output. 

**Hang-man**: Developed a word-guessing puzzle that can be played with friends.
              It is a indian version of the famous game hangman ( https://thewordsearch.com/hangman )
              Took special measures to handle all possible edge cases and expections.
